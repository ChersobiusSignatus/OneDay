OneDay

OneDay is my first ever beta visual dating simulator with Genshin Impact character called Xiao. 
Titile reflects one day with him and the time I spent making this. Also, in one day
I decided I don't want to be involved in game dev. Thanks to it I realized what
path i want to choose in coding.
RenPy is used here as it is the most known Novel Engine and easy-to-use.

HOW TO INSTALL:
Open file named OneDay.exe and hit "Start".
